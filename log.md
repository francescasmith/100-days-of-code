# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: 18 May 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Did some planning and decided on a few things to do - will focus on Python.  I set up accounts and the git reposity. Some goals I'd like to work towards:
      - Become confident with Python
      - Create a interface for my CFG project
      - Process some shapefiles/rasters using Python
      - Learn about how multiple languagues interact with eachother/tech infrastructure
