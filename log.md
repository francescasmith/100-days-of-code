### Day 0: 18 May 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Did some planning and decided on a few things to do - will focus on Python.  I set up accounts and the git reposity. Some goals I'd like to work towards:
      - Become confident with Python
      - Create a interface for my CFG project
      - Process some shapefiles/rasters using Python
      - Learn about how multiple languagues interact with eachother/tech infrastructure

### Day 1: 19 May 2021

**Today's Progress**: At work I often have list of items in excel that i need to use in an SQL statement. Thought i would try and automate this. 


**Thoughts**: feels good to be solving a real problem. The for/while loops were defintley trial and error but find i learn most from things i do wrong. Harder part will be reading from a file - will do tomorrow.

### Day 2: 20 May 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Did a class with Code First Girls on Web devlopment - learnt HTML and made an about me page


**Thoughts**: enjoyed it - can already tell i love the backend more. Its good to know this though as it will make me a better coder all around. loved the analogy of HTML is  the bones, CSS is the skin and JavaScript is the nervous system.
